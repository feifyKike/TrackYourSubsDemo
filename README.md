## 🧾 Where can I get this?
At the moment, the app is not available in the app store. But with further improvement and support it might some day. 🤞 If you feel as though this app should see the light of day, I ask that you please leave a star for this repository. 🙏

## 🔮 Future Implementations
+ Tic Tac Toe monthly timeline in `EditView.swift` to show track record of payments for that subscription.
+ Add streak for each subscription separately.
